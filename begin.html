		<p> It is quite common for men or persons to feel that they are not quite the person they would like to be.
			so basically we might feel that need to seek a better lifestyle in order to ditch the bad habits and replace them with good ones. Obviously these bad habits could be anything, from addiction (which is the most common) of all soughts to things like going late to work. So here are 3 basic tips on how to be a better human.

			<h2>Belief</h2>
		</a>
		<p>First and foremost is the initial thought or intention. Some might ask why this is important. Well the answer to that is, if one does not have the conviction and belief that indeed he/she can be a better person then the process cannot come to fruition as the person would be discouraged even before starting. Hence the importance of one convincing himself that it is possible for he/she to become a better human. This is the only way to break the cycle which from my personal experience is one of the hardest steps to achieve. This is due to the fact that one already convinced the brain that there is nothing wrong with these habits and one cannot live without doing it. When in actuality, one never needed these habits anyways</p>

			<h2>Consistency</h2>
		</a>
		<p>Now a lot of people do belief they can change for the better however, we all know life is not in black and white. Situations will change, so will emotion and one's state of mind. These changes are probably the most difficult aspects to handle because you will be caught up with going back to old habits or to keep pushing. Relapses are very common and the only way to avoid them is by avoided situations which often lead to it. By consistently doing, you become much more stronger attaining higher levels of consistency.</p>

			<h2>Resolve</h2>
		</a>
		<p>A lot times one might wonder what is the point of all this or may feel the results are not evident and it's all just a waste of time. In this state all you want to just do is quit. But we are not quitters are we now? All these feelings are totally permissible because we're all human and we aren't perfect. These doubts usually occur in the early stages of the entire process because it's not easy starting what you are not used to. This is where we have to be resolute and determined to be a better person. It's not enought to believe or be consistent, when going gets tough can you keep your? Can you stamp your feet and oppose regression? Why should we through away all our hours, days, weeks of hardwork just because feelings that wont last long? This right there is how you build and strengthen your resolve. I have regressed and relapsed a countless number of times for almost <strong>2 freaking years !</strong> and i always feel terrible about it because no one knows if they may die without mending their ways and fixing ruined relationships due to these bad habits. So one must stay strong so you can finally move forward</p>
